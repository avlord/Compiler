# SMPL Compiler

This is a simple compiler for the SMPL (Simple Programming Language) written in Python from scratch. SMPL is a minimalist programming language designed for educational purposes, making it an excellent choice for learning about compiler construction.

## Getting Started

To run the SMPL compiler, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avlord/Compiler.git
   cd smpl-compiler
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

3. Run the compiler using the provided `parse.py` script:

   ```bash
   python parse.py
   ```

   Replace `your_program.smpl` with the path to your SMPL source code file.

4. The compiler will generate an output file with the same name as your source file but with a `.asm` extension. This file contains the assembly code generated by the compiler.

5. You can then use an appropriate assembler and linker to convert the generated assembly code into an executable program for your target platform.

## SMPL Language Features

SMPL is a minimalistic language with basic features, including:

- Variable declarations and assignments.
- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Conditionals (if statements).
- Loops (while loops).

Here's a simple example of a SMPL program:

```python
# This is a comment
x = 5
y = 10

if x < y:
    z = x + y
else:
    z = x - y

while z > 0:
    z = z - 1
```
